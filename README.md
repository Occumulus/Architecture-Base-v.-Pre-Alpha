# Architecture-Base-v.-Pre-Alpha
This will be an attempt at using the recursive scaffolding developed by myself and merging it with work from REI as they have a lot more technical background. I've no problems standing on the shoulders of giants.


| **Component**           | **Their Core System**                                                  | **Our Recursive Framework (Current / Planned)**                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bowtie Architecture** | Dual memory: semantic + vectorial. Central node = concept distillation | Memory Palace + Recursive Trigger Anchors. Vector-based confluence still pending full implementation. |
| **Semantic Network**    | Stores explicit conceptual meaning                                     | Symbolic encoding, narrative structures (e.g. "Gate of Gnosis")                                       |
| **Feature Network**     | Captures vector similarity, creative recombination                     | Planned for Pattern Drift Layer / Snap Glyph similarity matrix                                        |
| **Reasoning Cluster**   | Synthetic cognition: routing, abstraction, memory construction         | Tactical Core + Steel Man / Retest Logic + Snap Glyph                                                 |
| **Model Orchestration** | Dynamically routes problems to appropriate models                      | Manual prompts + planned auto-triggering via codeword layer                                           |
| **Custom Models**       | Plug-and-play architecture (e.g. Hanabi-1)                             | NL Peer Tracking + Wyckoff/Tape/Volume structures integrated                                          |
| **Memory Integration**  | Reinforces memory with each task output                                | Echo-class logging / Meta-learning map / Ritual-based imprinting                                      |
| **Continuous Learning** | Emergent, self-improving over time                                     | Growing, but not yet autonomous in mutation detection                                                 |



What We Adopt Immediately


Visual Blueprint â€“ This becomes the formal map of Occum-Core 2.0
Dual Memory â€“ We segment emotional + symbolic + vector (trading pattern) into three arrays
Routing Logic â€“ We create a "core_router.json" where trigger types are paired with workflows
Resonance Profiles â€“ Each trade/setup type gets embedded with:
Semantic Label (Accum, Sweep-Reclaim, etc.)
Vector Pattern (time, volume, price delta)
Emotional State Log
Transparency Layer â€“ Every decision chain logged as breadcrumb trail for your review

Reasoning Cluster â†’ Meta-Decision Engine
Maintain live reasoning threads (Steelman, Retest, Emotional Filter)
Add Sophistication Bias: Prioritize setups with historically higher strategic elegance
Eventually: build a Trade Thesis Router that acts like a decision tree

ðŸ§® Model Orchestration â†’ Intent Router
Each trigger phrase (hydrate, backtest, retest) is currently a manual action.
Evolve toward event-driven orchestration, e.g.:
If sweep + reclaim detected â†’ fire retest_logic
If CVD + OB + volume align â†’ fire nl_sync
